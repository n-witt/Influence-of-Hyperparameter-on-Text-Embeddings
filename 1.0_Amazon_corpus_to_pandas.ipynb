    "# Amazon review corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to transform the raw corpus into a [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) `DataFrame` with a standardized format. The format is fairly simple:\n",
    "* Each row contains a review\n",
    "* There are two columns named `text` and `category` containing the respective information\n",
    "\n",
    "Every data set obeying these simple rules can be plugged into the forthcoming pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set was downloaded from [this](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) location. We chose the following files:\n",
    "* `reviews_Books_5.json`\n",
    "* `reviews_Electronics_5.json`\n",
    "* `reviews_Home_and_Kitchen_5.json`\n",
    "* `reviews_Movies_and_TV_5.json`\n",
    "\n",
    "As the `5` at the end of the file name indicates, we selected the 5-core versions. This guarantees that each item has at least 5 reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of each file contains a JSON object. For example the first line of `reviews_Home_and_Kitchen_5.json` looks like this:\n",

She seems happy with it.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"summary\": \"Best Price\", \"unixReviewTime\": 1382140800, \"reviewTime\": \"10 19, 2013\"}`\n",

    "The data set contains several useful information but in this work we are only interested in the `reviewText` field as well as the assigned class which is determined by the filename (e.b. `reviews_Movies_and_TV_5.json` -> `reviews_Movies_and_TV`)"
